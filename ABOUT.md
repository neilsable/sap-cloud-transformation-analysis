Most portfolio projects:

- Lack business context
- Don't connect to real-world decisions

This project:
- Analyzes a real, active company (SAP) using current data (Q3 2025)
- Contains ZERO estimations - every number traceable
- Provides actionable strategic recommendations
- Could actually inform business decisions
